   git clone git@github.com:your-org/qa-helper.git
   cd qa-helper
   ```
2. Install prerequisites:

## How to Report Bugs
If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior:
1. Check existing issues to see if itâ€™s already reported.
2. If not, open a new GitHub issue and include:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Logs or stack traces (if applicable)
   - Platform (OS, Java version)

---

## Feature Requests
To suggest new features or improvements:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue labeled **enhancement**.
3. Describe your use case, proposed API or UI changes, and any alternatives youâ€™ve considered.

---

## Development Workflow
We follow the [Implementation Plan & Guidelines](/docs/QA%20Helper%20Implementation%20Plan%20&%20Guidelines.md) to break work into discrete tasks.

### Branching Strategy
- Create a topic branch off `main` for each task:  
  ```
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git checkout -b phaseX/task-description
  ```
- Branch names must follow: `phase{N}/{short-task}` (e.g., `core/spi-interfaces`).

### Commit Messages
- Use Conventional Commits format:  
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  ```
- Types:
  - `feat`: new feature
  - `fix`: bug fix
  - `chore`: build or tooling changes
  - `docs`: documentation only
  - `test`: tests only
  - `ci`: CI configuration
- Include issue or task reference in the footer, e.g.:  
  ```
  Closes #123
  ```

### Pull Requests
1. Push your branch:  
   ```
   git push origin phaseX/task-description
   ```
2. Open a PR against `main` with:
   - Title: `<type>: <short summary>`
   - Description:
     - Task reference (e.g., `Closes phase2/task 2.1`).
     - Summary of changes.
     - Testing instructions.
3. Ensure CI passes and all tests are green.
4. Request reviews from maintainers (`@maintainers`).

---

## Testing
- Run all tests locally before submitting:  
  ```bash
  ./gradlew clean test
  ```
- Aim for high coverage; write unit and integration tests for new modules.
- Linting and static analysis run automatically in CI.

---

## Style Guidelines
- Follow the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Adhere to formatting rules enforced by `ktlint` and `detekt`.
- Keep methods short and focused; write clear, descriptive names.

---

## Documentation
- Update or add examples in `README.md` or `docs/` when introducing new features.
- Document extension points and SPIs in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`.

---

## Release Process
See [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for the full release checklist, including versioning, changelog updates, and publishing artifacts.

---

## Contact & Support
For questions or assistance, reach out to the project maintainers or open an issue on GitHub.
