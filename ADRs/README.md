# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the QA Helper project. Each ADR captures a significant design decision, its context, and its consequences.

## ADR Conventions

- **Filename**: Start with a unique, sequential number and a short title, e.g., `0001-use-kotlin-compose-ui.md`.

- **Format**: Markdown with the following structure:

  ```markdown
  # ADR {number}: {Short Title}

  **Status**: {Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded}

  ## Context
  A brief description of the issue or problem that required a decision.

  ## Decision
  The chosen solution and rationale.

  ## Consequences
  The implications, positive and negative, of the decision.
  ```

- **Linking**: Refer to related ADRs by number. Update status when decisions change.

## Example ADR

See `0001-use-kotlin-compose-ui.md` for a sample decision record.
